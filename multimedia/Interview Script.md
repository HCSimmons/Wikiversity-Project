# Interview Script

###### Question 1:

So I started working with Wikipedia in 2004 as a graduate student at the University of Georgia when I was working on my PhD. I was interested in and remain interested  in teaching with technology. I discovered wikipedia and was interested in it and it immediately struck me as a place where folks could write. 


###### Question 2:

I have dialogue with people in development for Wikiversity. I have not talked with Wikiversity. I am just kind of on a casual level familiar with the project.


###### Question 3:

Yeah absolutely it's really hard to look at it now and think oh well somebody at the University of Mississippi is going to teach with this instead of a textbook, but that's not the right comparison. The right comparison is somebody who is not in the higher education system. So, it would probably be somebody who's seeking in education who is outside, you know, un-enrolled or is not part of western or traditional higher education. So someone who doesn't have means to get to campus or to enroll in a program, I think that is a place where Wikiversity will be most useful. 


###### Question 4:

A couple years ago there was someone who already had started the idea of creating a
university and the basic model, I think it was somebody in Israel. The basic model was we’ll go to content experts, so like biology one, we’ll go find biology professors, we’ll get them to design an end of course assessment and then if you want to attend our university, we're just going to steer you the Wikiversity pages on biology, then we’ll administer the exam that these other experts created and then if you pass the exam you get the credit and it'll cost you, you know, very very little. 


###### Question 5:

Most people don't know what the difference of wikimedia and wikipedia is. The know that wikipedia is an instance of a wiki and also instance particular brand of Wicky called wikimedia. And that Wikiversity is one of several wikimedia projects, right, and so you all probably know that because you know what Wikiversity is, but most people wouldn't know about it.Do I think that we ought to, you know, promote greater awareness? I really have a pretty syncline opinion about that. I think that if people need wikiversity they'll find it. 


###### Question 6:

Was a moment of panic for a lot of people in higher education because it's a {unknown} that if you can build this “Sebastian {unknown}” course and then basically give it away, is our model for higher education just gonna disappear? Right, why would you come and pay us thirty thousand dollars a year to get a bachelor's at the University of Mississippi in, we’ll say, a computer science BS when you could go to Udacity or Coursera, coursera was the company they made out of this concept. So, “MOOC” was M-O-O-C, massively open online course.


###### Question 7:

You're not here at the University of Mississippi just to learn course content. There's a lot of things that are sewn up or bundled together in higher education. Okay, first of all it's like that degree from having a BA or BS has market value and means something. That PDF from Sebastian {unknown} doesn't mean as much. Now he's a Stanford professor, so that means a lot but not everybody in Coursera was a Stanford professor. So,  then it's also social aspect. You come to make friends and join Greek organizations, you meet people you network with later in your life. It's also an identity and a culture shift. You leave where you were, you come here, you leave, and your different. All those different things are sort of bundled together. So, it gets back to Wikiversity in the sense that there's not a lot of people that are out there saying, “Hmmm, do I want to go to Ole Miss or do I want to go work on university?” Because they're just do two different experiences. 


###### Question 8:

There are several projects that are out there that are just kind of volunteer driven, and like say you want to learn a different computer language for coding and you're already in computer science well there's free courses out there that you can take, you just need to know that you know JavaScript language and you already know some computer science. So, you just need skills enhancement. There's a lot of that that's out there now, but that's separate from the credential of undergraduate learning.
