Activities:
Teacher asks the students about culture and what all the different parts of culture there are and makes a list on board.
The teacher will then place the students into small groups. 
Each group chooses which section they would like to complete from the board.
The small groups will begin to look for credible information from credible sources to use for their section. 
Once the research is done, all the groups will partner up doing a group review to look over what the other groups have so far and make sure they are on the right track.
The groups will then type up the section they have on the culture and put it on the class Wikiversity page that has been made for the culture they are working on.  
Each group must incorporate: pictures, links, credible information and valid sources
Once every group has completed their section and it is uploaded to the class Wikiversity page the teacher will push the page out to go “live” where other viewers will be able to see the work they have accomplished.
Closure:
Have the students write why they think learning about other cultures in today’s society is important on a sticky note and then place it on the board. Read one or two of the sticky notes aloud and make sure the class completely understands why it is important to know other cultures besides their own.
