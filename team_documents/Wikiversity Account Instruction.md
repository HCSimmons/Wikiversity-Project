# HOW TO MAKE A WIKIVERSITY ACCOUNT


1. First, go to [Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page) and in the top right hand corner of the screen you will see a tab that says "Create Account." Click it!!!

2. Once you are on this page, enter in all the necesary information. I have added an example from my own account to help. 




3. After you have entered in all of the information and clicked "Create Account" on the bottom, you will be brought back to the main screen. The tabs located on the top right hand of the screen will be different. Press the tab that says "Sandbox."




4. Here is your work space. In this big box you will enter all of the information you and your group have come up with. This includes, but is not limited to text, pictures, links, etc.




####**YOU ARE ALL PERMITTED TO HAVE YOUR OWN WIKIVERSITY ACCOUNTS.**

With this being said, it is crusial that you take time outside of class to collect information on your topic. You will have time in class for groups to work together and organize all of the data on to one sandbox.
